# Conversational_Chatbot_using_LSTM-RNNs
This project is to create conversational chatbot using Sequence to sequence LSTM models. Sequence to sequence learning is about training models to convert from one domain to sequences another domain.
      Language: Python 3.13
      Dataset:use a small conversational dataset
      Pakages Used: numpy,pyTorch,sklearn, tensorflow, keras
      Model Used: Seq2Seq LSTM and RNNs model
  Observations and Suggestions:
step 1:-Data Limitation
a.The dataset is very small and simple, which makes it insufficient for training a robust model.
b.The model will likely overfit the given data and won't generalize well.
c.Solution: Expand the dataset with more diverse conversational pairs to improve the model's learning and performance.
step 2:-Output Mismatch
The generate_response function assumes the model will output meaningful sequences. However, as the output is tokenized and one-hot encoded, decoding the model's predictions directly into coherent text may not work as expected.
Solution: Use a greedy or beam search decoding method to interpret the model's predictions correctly.
step 3:-Training Loss
You're using categorical_crossentropy for the output, which is fine since you one-hot encoded the outputs. However, the high-dimensional output (vocab_size classes) can make convergence slow.
Solution: Consider using a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture with separate encoder and decoder layers, which is more effective for conversational AI.
step 4:-Epochs
Training for 500 epochs on such a small dataset might lead to overfitting.
Solution: Use early stopping and evaluate model performance on a validation set.
step 5:-Generate Response Function
The generate_response function outputs text directly from predictions, which might not be meaningful since it doesn't consider sequence generation.
